{"name":"WiDNR 2016","tagline":"Materials for \"Introduction to R using the FM Database\" at the WiDNR Statewide Meeting, 7-Mar-16","body":"This half-day workshop will provide an introduction (or reintroduction) to R for fisheries biologists and technicians in the Wisconsin DNR.  The first two hours will introduce basic R concepts and methods for size structure analyses with data from the Fisheries Management Database.  In the second two hours, participants may choose one of two tracks.  The first track will continue with the basic introduction by having participants apply what was learned in the first two hours in a moderated hands-on activity.  The second track will provide participants with an introduction to plotting fisheries data with the ggpplot2 R package.\r\n\r\n## Pre-Course Preparation\r\nPerform the following tasks before the workshop.\r\n* Install R and RStudio — Complete with the help of the State IT consultants.
