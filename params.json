{"name":"WiDNR 2016","tagline":"Materials for \"Introduction to R using the FM Database\" at the WiDNR Statewide Meeting, 8-Mar-16","body":"This half-day workshop will provide an introduction (or reintroduction) to R for fisheries biologists and technicians in the Wisconsin DNR.  The first two hours will introduce basic R concepts and methods for size structure analyses with data from the Fisheries Management Database.  In the second two hours, participants may choose one of two tracks.  The first track will continue with the basic introduction by having participants apply what was learned in the first two hours in a moderated hands-on activity.  The second track will provide participants with an introduction to plotting fisheries data with the ggplot2 R package.\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\n## Pre-Course Preparation\r\nPerform the following tasks before the workshop.\r\n* **Install R and RStudio** — Complete with the help of your RIMS.  Directions for installing on personal computers [are here](http://derekogle.com/IFAR/supplements/).  The most recent version of R is 3.2.3 and RStudio is 0.99.491.\r\n* **Prepare RStudio** — The directions in [this link](http://derekogle.com/IFAR/supplements/installations/InstallRStudioWin.html#configuring-rstudio) will help you prepare RStudio for most effective use.\r\n* **Install Packages** --  The directions in [this link](https://github.com/droglenc/fishWiDNR#installation) will make sure that your RStudio can use all special purpose programs required for the workshop.\r\n* **Getting Started with RStudio** — Review the material in [this link](http://derekogle.com/IFAR/supplements/installations/InstallRStudioWin.html#introducing-rstudio) to get a feel for the primary software used in the workshop.\r\n* **Create a Workshop Folder** — Create a folder on your computer that will contain all materials from the workshop (for those described in the next bullet and created at the workshop).\r\n* **Download Materials** — Download (right-click and either *\"Save As ...\"*, *\"Save File As ...\"*, *\"Save Target As ...\"*, or *\"Save Link as\"* depending on your browser) the two items below to the folder you created above.\r\n    * [Size Structure Demonstration Script](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/droglenc/RcourseWiDNR2016/master/SizeStruc_WT.R)\r\n    * [Sawyer Co. Demonstration Data](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/droglenc/RcourseWiDNR2016/master/SAWYER_fish_raw_data_012915.csv).  This is a large file (21 mb) so be patient.  It is also available in the central FH_PROJECTS location (\\central\\Water\\FH_PROJECTS\\SV_ContinuingEducation\\R Workshop) on the WiDNR network.\r\n* (*Optional*) **Print Handout** — [This handout](https://github.com/droglenc/RcourseWiDNR2016/raw/master/SizeStruc_WT.pdf) provides written details of the functions and processes for size structure analyses that will be demonstrated in the workshop.  You may want to print this for reference and to take notes on during the workshop.\r\nhttps://cdn.rawgit.com/<your user name>/<your repo>/master/index.html\r\nPlease [contact me](mailto:dogle@northland.edu) with any questions.\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\n## Follow-Up\r\n* Please complete this survey regarding this workshop.\r\n* Following the course, please feel free to contact me if you have any questions.\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\n## Useful Websites\r\n* [fishR](http://derekogle.com/fishR/)\r\n* [Introductory Fisheries Analyses with R Book](http://derekogle.com/IFAR/)\r\n* Learning Resources — [Reference Card](http://cran.r-project.org/doc/contrib/Short-refcard.pdf), [data wrangling cheatsheet](http://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/data-wrangling-cheatsheet.pdf), [Quick-R](http://www.statmethods.net/)\r\n* General Help — [StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/r)\r\n* Color-related — [colorBrewer](http://colorbrewer2.org/), [named colors](http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~tzheng/files/Rcolor.pdf)\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
