        <p>This half-day workshop will provide an introduction (or reintroduction) to R for fisheries biologists and technicians in the Wisconsin DNR.  The first two hours will introduce basic R concepts and methods for size structure analyses with data from the Fisheries Management Database.  In the second two hours, participants may choose one of two tracks.  The first track will continue with the basic introduction by having participants apply what was learned in the first two hours in a moderated hands-on activity.  The second track will provide participants with an introduction to plotting fisheries data with the ggplot2 R package.</p>

<a id="pre-workshop-preparation" class="anchor" href="#pre-workshop-preparation" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Pre-Workshop Preparation</h2>

<p>Perform the following tasks before the workshop.</p>

<ul>
<li>
<strong>Install R and RStudio</strong> — You will need at least R version 3.1.2 and RStudio version 0.99.XXX for the workshop.  If you participated in a similar workshop last year, then you should have adequate versions.  If you did not or have not had R/RStudio installed on your computer, then you will need to work with your RIMS to have it installed on your work computer prior to the workshop.  <a href="http://derekogle.com/IFAR/supplements/">Here are directions for installing R/RStudio on a personal computer</a>.</li>
<li>
<strong>Prepare RStudio</strong> — The default settings for RStudio can be modified for more effective use during the workshop (and after).  <a href="http://derekogle.com/IFAR/supplements/installations/InstallRStudioWin.html#configuring-rstudio">Here are my suggested modifications</a>.</li>
<li>
<strong>Install Packages</strong> -- Workshop materials depend on several additional packages being installed for R/Rstudio, including the FSA and fishWiDNR packages.  If you took the workshop last year, then these packages need to be updated.  If you did not take the workshop last year, then these packages need to be installed.  <a href="https://github.com/droglenc/fishWiDNR#installation">Follow these directions to install or update the packages required for the workshop</a>.</li>
<li>
<strong>Getting Started with RStudio</strong> — Review <a href="http://derekogle.com/IFAR/supplements/installations/InstallRStudioWin.html#introducing-rstudio">this material that briefly introduces RStudio</a>.</li>
<li>
<strong>Create a Workshop Folder</strong> — Create a folder on your computer that will contain all materials from the workshop (for those described below and created at the workshop).</li>
<li>
<strong>Download Data</strong> -- We will use a pull of Raw Fish Data from the Fisheries Management Database in the workshop.  You should download this file from the internal WiDNR server at <a href="%5CdnrcentralWATERFH_ProjectsSV_ContinuingEducationRWorkshopsMarch2015SAWYER_fish_raw_data_012915.7z">Y:\SV_ContinuingEducation\R\Workshops\March2015\SAWYER_fish_raw_data_012915.7z</a> (<em>link will only work when connected to the internal WiDNR server</em>) and unzip it into the folder you created above.</li>
</ul>

<p>The following two items should be completed before the workshop but please wait until as close to the workshop date as possible in case we make any more changes to these between now and then.</p>

<ul>
<li>
<strong>Download Script</strong> -- In the first two hours of the workshop, <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/droglenc/RcourseWiDNR2016/master/SizeStruc_WT.R">this script</a> will be used to demonstrate the use of R within the context of size structure analyses.  You should download this material (right-click link and either <em>"Save As ..."</em>, <em>"Save File As ..."</em>, <em>"Save Target As ..."</em>, or <em>"Save Link as"</em> depending on your browser) to the folder you created above.</li>
<li>(<em>Optional</em>) <strong>Print Handout</strong> — <a href="https://github.com/droglenc/RcourseWiDNR2016/raw/master/SizeStruc_WT.pdf">This handout</a> provides written details of the functions and processes for size structure analyses that will be demonstrated with the script above.  You may want to print this for reference and to take notes on during the workshop.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>
<strong>Part I - R Introduction "Lecture"</strong> -- Introduction to basic R concepts and methods for size structure analyses with Sawyer County Raw Fish Data pulled from the Fisheries Management Database.  Participants may follow along "live" with the R script or on the detailed R handout downloaded before the workshop (as described above).</li>
<li>
<strong>Part II, Track 1 - R Introduction "Hands-On"</strong> -- Participants will develop proficiency with R for size structure analysis of Raw Fish Data from the Fisheries Management Database by completing <a href="https://github.com/droglenc/RcourseWiDNR2016/raw/master/SizeStruc_HW.pdf">this exercise</a>.</li>
